                        <p class="p1">Big Box Souq was founded by Zainab Malubhai in 2021, a mother of two, living in Dubai. Zainab began to recognize the frustrations of ordering groceries online, particularly with food wastage due to large minimum quantities, finding environmentally conscious businesses, and a great variety of fresh fruit and vegetables that were readily available.</p>
                        <p class="p2">I recognized that it was incredibly difficult to find a grocery delivery company that would let you order the exact quantity that you needed, at a reasonable price, with an environmentally conscious mindset. As a mother of two, I wanted to be able to order food for my family that was fresh, with no food wastage, and that understood the impact food wastage and repackaging had on our environment. Therefore, I wanted to create a new grocery concept that had healthy, mindful eating at the core of it’s values
